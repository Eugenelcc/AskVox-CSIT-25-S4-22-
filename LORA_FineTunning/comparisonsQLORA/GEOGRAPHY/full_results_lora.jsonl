Dried grass, leaves, and light branches are flash fuels, igniting readily and allowing fire to spread quickly, often generating enough heat to ignite heavier fuels like tree stumps, heavy limbs, and the organic matter of the forest floor. These heavier fuels are ordinarily slow to ignite and difficult to extinguish. Green fuels\u2014growing vegetation\u2014are not considered flammable, but an intense fire can dry out leaves and needles quickly enough to allow ready ignition.", "prediction": "Different types of vegetation play a significant role in the spread and intensity of wildfires. Grasslands and shrublands are highly flammable and can spread fires quickly, while forests with dense canopies can create firebreaks. Chaparral and savannas are also prone to fires, and the moisture content of vegetation affects fire behavior.", "time_s": 4.027912378311157}
